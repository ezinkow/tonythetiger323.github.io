## About This Project:
Portfolio-Update is a site I had to make for homework, as part of the Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, whose purpose was to update our portfolio page be presentable to employers for possible employment opportunities.

Portfolio-Update was built using the [Mi. - Ultimate Personal Resume vCard Template](https://themeforest.net/item/mi-ultimate-personal-resume-vcard-template/13308494?ref=suelo) which utilizes HTML, Bootstrap3, vanilla javascript, jQuery, PHP, and the Google Maps API

I would also like to thank and acknowledge all the personal tutoring I have gotten from [Miguel](http://www.miguel.cab/), he has done so much to help, and challenges me often to take my learning beyond what I learn in class.
